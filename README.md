# TeamProGen
In this program it creates a HTML for a team page that is comprised of 3 different employee roles and 4 objects; Manager,Engineer, and Intern using a general Employee object to create each. It prompts a user to input for info based on what role the person is and the contact information associated with their role. Each role has slight information differences, and while there can only be one Manager there can be multiple of the other roles. 

This program utilizes the Node.js javascript runtime environment to prompt the user for their feedback and uses object oriented programming that uses the jest extension for testing and the inquirer extension for communication with objects and javascript actions. A user must clone the code from the repository and download Node.js and then install jest to test the interactions for the objects . Inquirer must be installed to be able to get the javascript actions to interact properly with the objects that are generated. 

After inquirer is installed you must run "node index" in the command prompt to be prompted for user information inputs, once a user has made adequate selections and is satisfied with their choices an index.html is generated in the src folder. This HTML can then be opened in the default browser to show the Team that was selected and the output along with links to the emails of each that when clicked will open up the default email program. The engineer has an additional link that will bring a user to their github profile. 

I have a attached a screenshot of the HTML output as well as a video demonstration showing the passing of all 4 objects using jest "npm run test" and user input in node to show the output in the HTML. 

This program uses Node.js javascript runtime environment as well as Inquirer and jest extensions, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
